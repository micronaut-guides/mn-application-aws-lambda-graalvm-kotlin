Please, read about https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-aws/latest/guide/index.html#lambda[Micronaut AWS Lambda Support] to learn more about different Lambda runtime, Triggers and Handlers and how to integrate with a Micronaut application.

The biggest problem with Java applications and Lambda is how to mitigate Cold startups. Executing GraalVM Native images of a Micronaut function in a Lambda Custom runtime is a solution to this problem.

In this guide, we are going to deploy a Micronaut Application as a GraalVM Native image to a AWS Lambda custom runtime. If your Lambda integrates with https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html[API Gateway via a Lambda Proxy], a Micronaut function of type `Application` with the `aws-lambda` feature is a good fit. Specially, when you have multiple endpoints which you wish to delegate to a single Lambda.
